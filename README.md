# Deciphering Molecular Pathways in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing publicly available gene expression datasets to uncover dysregulated pathways and biomarkers associated with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). The datasets used are:
1. *GSE107490*: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from MDS patients and healthy controls.
2. *GSE61853*: Expression profiles from MDS patients and controls.

The project leverages R and Python for data preprocessing, differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and machine learning-based clustering.

# Data Preprocessing
- R:
  - Gene expression data normalized using `normalizeBetweenArrays` (quantile normalization).
  - Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the `limma` package.
  - Top DEGs filtered based on log fold change (logFC â‰¥ 2) and adjusted p-value (p < 0.05).
  
- Python:
  - Applied K-means clustering on PCA-reduced data.
  - Hierarchical clustering with Spearman correlation.
  - Machine learning approaches using Random Forest for classification.

# Results
# Differential Expression Analysis
- *GSE107490*:
  - *Upregulated genes*: 1,040 (e.g., `IFI6`, `LDHA`).
  - *Downregulated genes*: 1,277 (e.g., `SERPINE2`, `CCN2`).

- *GSE61853*:
  - *Upregulated genes*: 1,852.
  - *Downregulated genes*: 1,519.

# Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment
- Enriched biological processes include:
  - mRNA processing and protein synthesis.
  - Nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic processes.
  - SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membranes.

# KEGG Pathway Enrichment
- Key enriched pathways:
  - Ribosome and protein synthesis pathways.
  - Cellular response to infection (COVID-19, Legionellosis, Salmonella).
  - Oxytocin signaling pathway, potentially involved in MDS pathogenesis.

# Clustering and Network Analysis
- K-means Clustering:
  - Identified three distinct clusters for both datasets, reflecting genetic subtypes.
  - Segments provide insights into variability in prognosis and treatment response.

- Hierarchical Clustering:
  - Generated dendrograms to visualize genetic similarities among samples.
  - Highlighted regulatory networks disrupted in MDS.

- Random Forest Classification:
  - GSE61853 model accuracy: 0.21%.
  - Indicates high complexity and heterogeneity in MDS datasets.
